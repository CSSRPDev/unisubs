This app handles notifiying users based on certain events.  It's responsible for things like:

  - Who should recieve an email and/or a message when a certain event occurs
  - Rendering the emails text/HTML
  - User configurable blocking of certain notifications
  - User configurable limits on how often they get emails

It shouldn't be confused with the notifications app, which handles HTTP
notifications to some of our enterprise teams.
