Fix the setup index code situation

With south, we ran this command setup_indexes to setup indexes that django
didn't handle natively.

With django migrations, we can make this command a regular migration.

The issue is that for production/staging/dev, the SQL code has already run,
but the migration isn't logged in the system.

The other issue is that when we first created the indexes, we needed to make
them MyISAM tables.  But now that we're using a newer mysql version, we can
use InnoDB like all the other tables.  The last issue is that the setup
indexes code removed the foreign key constraint from videos_videoindex to
videos_video.

This command fixes all the above issues.

After running this command, the videos_videoindex table should look like this:


CREATE TABLE `videos_videoindex` (
  `video_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `text` longtext CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci,
  PRIMARY KEY (`video_id`),
  FULLTEXT KEY `ft_text` (`text`),
  CONSTRAINT `videos_videoindex_video_id_3142f0647972eaeb_fk_videos_video_id` FOREIGN KEY (`video_id`) REFERENCES `videos_video` (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_bin
"""
