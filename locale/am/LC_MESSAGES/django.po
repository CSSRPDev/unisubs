"\n"
"            The focus of this summit is increased availability and better usability for captions and subtitles, \n"
"            which are both sorely needed. It comes at a critical time, \n"
"            as internet video usage is skyrocketing&mdash;people who rely on captions are threatened to be left behind. \n"
"            New users from every culture are coming online en masse; \n"
"            standardizing and ubiquitizing the technology can make potential audiences exponentially larger and messages can cross cultural boundaries more easily. \n"
"            More captions will also make it simpler for computers to process, index, \n"
"            and make sense of the ever growing sea of online video.\n"
