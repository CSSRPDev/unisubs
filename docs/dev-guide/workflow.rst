Development Workflow
====================

This guide describes the development workflow for Amara.

.. contents::

Creating issues
---------------

Please follow these guidelines when creating issues, to ensure that they are
easy to implement:

  - Do a quick search to check for any existing issues before creating a new
    one.
  - Make sure the title clearly and succinctly captures the issue at hand
  - For bugs, describe the steps needed to reproduce the problem and what
    the correct behavior is.
  - Try to describe the severity of the issue.  Who is it affecting?  How bad
    is the current behavior, etc.

Branches / Repositories
-----------------------

The ``production`` branch is what gets deployed to our production server.
It's what gets deployed to production server.  The ``staging`` branch
is deployed just before the production as a test run.  It also is used by some
of our partners to test with non-live data.  The ``dev`` branch is our main
branch, and is continuously deployed whenever there's a new commit.

Commits should almost never be made directly to ``production`` or ``staging``
and only trivial commits should be made to ``dev``.  Instead, Amara development
tries to follow a "one branch per feature or bugfix" workflow (See
:ref:`Workflow <workflow>`)

When should you create a new branch?

  - Most issues should have a single branch created for them
  - When you are touching the same code in several issues, and/or when the
    functionality of the issues seem to be too dependent on each other to work,
    use a single branch for all issues
  - Also consider using a single branch for multiple issues if the testing is
    going to be the same for both.

As you work on your topic branch, other branches may have been merged into
``dev`` by other people.  Make sure you merge ``staging`` back to your branch
as often as possible to keep it up-to-date.

Git Submodules
--------------

The ``unisubs`` code contains several submodules that point to other repositories:

  - ``babelsubs``: https://github.com/pculture/babelsubs/
  - ``unilangs``: https://github.com/pculture/unilangs/
  - ``pykss``: https://github.com/pculture/pykss/
  - ``amara-assets``: https://github.com/pculture/amara-assets/
  - ``amara-enterprise``: https://github.com/pculture/amara-enterprise/ (private)


Initial checkout
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before you can run Amara, you need to check out the submodules.  Use the
``checkout-submodules`` script to do this.  There are two modes:

  - ``checkout-submodules public`` -- checkout the public submodules.  Use this
    if you are a member of the public.
  - ``checkout-submodules all`` -- checkout the all submodules.  Use this if
    you are a PCF employee with access to the private submodules.

Braches and submodules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use the following strategy to deal with branches:

  - Always create a branch on the ``unisubs`` repo, even if the only code
    changes are in other repositories.
  - If you need to change code in another repository, then create a branch
    there as well.  The name should match the branch name in unisubs.
  - If you create a commit in a submodule, make sure to also add a commit in
    ``unisubs`` to track the changes.  You can use the ``dev bump`` command to
    automate this in simple cases.

Switching branches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the ``dev switch [branch-name]`` command to switch branches.  This command
checks out the branch on unisubs, and also any submodules if needed.

Testing
-------

At a minimum, make sure you :ref:`run the tests <running-tests>`
after your changes and ensure that all tests pass.

If possible, use test driven development.  Write new tests that cover the
issue you're working on before you start any code.  Write code that makes the
test pass.  Then consider refactoring code to fix the problem in a cleaner
way.

Exception Logging
-----------------

When catching exceptions, be sure to log these with a descriptive message
and the stacktrace. Exceptions should be caught whenever it's necessary
for flow control, an exception is expected, or where user input may cause
unexpected behavior (such as forms). In the case where a caught exception is
an expected part of flow control, such as making an invalid choice in a form,
logging isn't necessary and doesn't need to be included.

As an example, here is a function that logs exceptions:

::

    def foo(self, a, b):
        try:
            self.do_something(a, b)
        except InvalidChoiceError:
            self.invalid_choice_count += 1
        except ValueError:
            logger.error("Invalid input type in Class.foo()", exc_info=True)
        except Exception:
            logger.error("General exception in foo()", exc_info=True)

Workflow
--------

We use zenhub for project management.  It's basically a chrome extension that
adds a kanban-like board to github.  You can get it from
https://www.zenhub.com/.

Zenhub adds a pipeline field to github issues.  We use this field to track the
current status of work on the issue.  We use the following pipelines:

  - ``Icebox`` -- Issues that have been deprioritized, or are inside an Epic to be scheduled later
  - ``Discovery`` -- Issues that need to be triaged further and/or prioritized
  - ``Waiting for Design`` -- Issues that need design decisions, mockups, or css before back-end implementation
  - ``To Do`` -- Scheduled issues that a developer hasn't started yet
  - ``In Progress`` -- Issues that a developer is currently working on
  - ``Testing`` -- Issue that a developer believes to be handled and needs
    testing to verify the fix
  - ``Waiting for Deploy`` -- Issue that has been fixed in the staging branch
    and we need to deploy the change to production

Here's the workflow for a typical issue:

  - **Prep work**

    - Someone creates a github issue that captures the bug/feature and puts it
      in the ``Discovery`` pipeline
    - The issue is prioritized and scheduled into a sprint
    - Developer reviews issue Friday before the sprint begins, adds story points
      to the issue

  - **Initial development**

    - A developer creates topic branches for both the ``unisubs`` and
      ``amara-enterprise`` repositories to handle the issue.  The branches
      should be named after its repository and issue number (e.g.
      ``gh-enterprise-1234`` or ``gh-unisubs-5678`` would be branches for
      github issue 1234 in the amara-enterprise repo and github issue 5678 in
      the unisubs repo, respectively).  Changes for the issue get commited to
      these branches.
    - Once development on the issue is complete, developer moves the issue
      to the ``Testing`` pipeline and adds any relevant notes for testing to
      the issue.

  - **Testing**

    - Tester tests the changes.
    - If there are problems, tester notes them on the issue and moves it back to ``In progress``.
    - Developer fixes the problems, adds a note to the issue, moves it back to ``Testing``, and we start testing again
    - Finally, tester approves the changes, then hands it back to developer to do a pull request

  - **Review**

    - Developer merges any new code from dev/master back into the topic branches
    - Developer creates a pull request in the unisubs repository
    - A second developer reviews the code
    - If there are issues, the developer #2 adds comments to the PR and works
      with developer #1 to resolve them
    - Once developer #2 thinks the code is ready, they merge the PR
    - If the code touches our submodule repositories (amara-entperprise,
      amara-assets, etc), then developer #1 should merge the changes back to master
    - Once we decide that staging is ready to be deployed to production, we will
      merge the staging branch to production then deploy andnd moves the issue
      to the ``Waiting for deploy`` pipeline

  - **Deploy**
    - At some point we will deploy the code.
    - Usually this happens on a monday.
    - We first deploy staging, do a check to see if things are okay, then deploy production
    - Once production is deployed, tester closes all issues in ``Waiting for deploy``
